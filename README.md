# Guessing_numbers
1) Our computer will generate a random number, and we will try to guess it until we guess the correct number, we will be given hint's for guessing the correct number
2) Then just implement the same thing in a reverse way when we will think of a number and our computer will try to guess that number untill it can guess the correct one
